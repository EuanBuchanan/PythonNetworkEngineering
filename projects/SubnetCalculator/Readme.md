# Subnet calculator

Application 1 code from Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/python-programming-for-real-life-networking-use/learn/v4/overview

Two versions, the first uses the method from the instructor, Mihai Catalin. While it was a useful exercise for understanidng bitwise operation, to my eyes the code looked messy. The second version used the netaddr module, which brings IPv4 and IPv6 manipulation to the code.
